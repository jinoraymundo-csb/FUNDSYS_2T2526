# Activity 01: Heterogeneous Data

Picture that you are helping manage the transactions of a local pharmacy and you have managed to gather from a notepad
these bits of data. Your task is to somehow "standardize" these data so we can derive better structured information from it.

1. Create a single Google Spreadsheet sheet (using your BMail account)
2. Define the columns that would be applicable for these 8 transactions
3. Encode these 8 transactions into their each individual row
4. Grant me (jino.raymundo@benilde.edu.ph) "view" permission to your spreadsheet. No need to notify me.
5. Get the shareable link, save as a one-line text file, and submit via dropbox
